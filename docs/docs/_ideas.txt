Ideas and ToDos
===============

- to do: the statistics page must not use the createRestEngine
         but instead go to the localStorage directly and get a snapshot
         (UX: should be obvious that is a snapshot )
         Stats: similar to wordle :-) 
         

- to do: on the autopopulate for currency put -Dcurrency=GBP instead of -Dcurrency


- we need to work out how to treat default values ??? 
  - e.g creating an account is it okay to default to "personal" or shall we force the user to specify the type ??? 
  

- we need to have a some generic config object

- we need to ensure that dashboard and billboard make changes more FLASHY !!!

- we need to rename "console" "Editor". Why ? console is getting mixed up with the developer console

- banking operations should document all possible errors ?

- interesting open sources: https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/ 
  and https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/


- we need to do some performance tests.
  (create thousands of accounts/customers)

- we need a monitoring table just for the last (3 or 5 or n) instructions we received  


- utility functions around bank object (so to avoid iterations of customers or account during rest methods)
  (e.g. findAccountsPerCustomer, ... )


- LOCAL STORAGE / indexedDB
  we will store every curl command. (this scales well as I only add to the storage/never rewrite)
  it comes with tons of additional benefits such a full history/audit of the banking events.
  gotcha: the uuid cannot be random (unless they get store them as well)


- DEFECT 
  when passing -Dparameters with spaces -Dtest = hello  
  it returns missing parameter test (it's difficult to understand that the white spaces are ignored)


CURL MODE FOR ACE
the curl mode should have a way to grey out the areas that it might ignore 
(e.g if a new line is put instead of backslash new line)

ACE EDITOR
- when text hits 10 lines or more it shifts a bit (can we size the column counter maybe)


ERROR HANDLING
  - create error code numbers (Web Page which lists them all and you can go to it for further help)
  - 
  - ... 


NEED A NAME FOR THE PROJECT SO TO NAME THE LIST OF VALID URLS 


NEED ABILITY TO GENERATE UNIQUE ID (only once) for user, unique object idcustomer (e.g. accounts, customers, ...)
-u 4375384957384 



UX: need a clear sense that the message is sent over the network... (eg. spinning wheel) when hitting the [send] button
    editing again the textaea might re-enable the btnSend
UX: We need animations for the grids of accounts, customers, logs, ...
